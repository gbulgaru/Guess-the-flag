# Welcome on Guess-the-flag!
Guess the flag is an online singleplayer browser game where you have to recognize the name of various countries from their flag and viceversa.\
All countries are supported!

## Tech insights
At the loading of the gameplay the browser makes a request to [REST countries APIs](restcountries.com) to get all the country names and codes for the selected continent.\
All matches for the selected continent are processed locally to reduce bandwitdh consumtion and waiting time.\

## Can I improve this project?
Of course, all contributions are welcome!
